 COUNTRY_INFO_URAL: "§G==The Ural League==§!\n\nIn the chaos of post-war Russia, there are many villains and few heroes. Nowhere is this split more apparent than in the Urals, where the soldiers of the §WUral League§! face off against the mad scientists of §RMagnitogorsk§! and the horrific bandits of the §RDirlewanger Brigade§!.\n\nThe warriors of the §WUral League§! were once mere prisoners and guards, locked in the Siberian wasteland of Vorkuta and left to rot. When the §RGermans§! invaded, however, all differences had to be thrown aside. Bound together by the influence of §WFather Janis Mendriks§! and the knowledge that, if neither worked with the other, all would perish, the guards and prisoners embarked on a long trek southwards, leaving only the worst of their ranks behind. Through the mountains they went, fighting off §Renemy§! after §Renemy§! as their numbers dwindled, finally settling down at the southern edge of the Urals, where they swore to protect the good and the innocent in the region.\n\nThe §WUral Guard§! has only hardened since that time, as the situation in the §WSouthern Urals§! has deteriorated greatly since their arrival. To the south, §RDirlewanger's Brigade§! wreaks havoc through the undefended souls of the area, raping, looting, and killing as they please. To the east, the §RBlack Mountain§! churns smoke as thousands flee from the experiments of §RTrofim Lysenko§! and the §RNKVD§!. To the west, the §GOrenburg Communes§! stand immobile, paralyzed by the constant bickering of their bloated system and unable to defend themselves.\n\nThe goals of the §WUral Guard§! are still the same as they were when they arrived, and it's certain that they'll give their all in attempting to fulfill it. Whether they'll succeed, however, is a question that is yet unresolved.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Defend your §Wallies§! in the Orenburg Communes from the menace of Dirlewanger's Brigade and Magnitogorsk\n\n*Choose between quality and quantity as you §Wbuild§! your army for the coming war\n\n*§WProtect§! the poor and damned throughout the Russian wastes from the myriad of bandits and thieves"

 COUNTRY_INFO_ORENBURG: "§G==ORENBURG==§!\n\nAmongst the vast Russian anarchy lies a secluded haven of stability: §WOrenburg.§! Existing as a neutral ground for the surrounding peasant villages, the city emerged as the de facto authority of the surrounding region following the collapse of the §GOld Soviet Union§!. §WOrenburg§! is a beacon of hope to the people of Russia in these dark and tumultuous times.\n\nPeasants and refugees are drawn to §WOrenburg§! like moths to a flame. Passing through the §GUral League§!, they bring with them stories, hungry mouths, and tired souls. So many make the long exodus to the promised land of the Southern Urals, giving everything for the chance at a better life, and so many are disappointed.\n\n§WOrenburg§! is bordered by the §GUral League§!, a militia dedicated to the protection of the people, and the §RDirlewanger Brigade§!, a bandit kingdom ruled by §RGerman§! fascists that never stopped their pillage. Beyond either of those lies §RMagnitogorsk, the Black Mountain§!, rumored to rest in the iron grip of a mad scientist and his §RNKVD§! minions.\n\nDecimated by the past war and constant §RGerman§! bombing runs, the economy of §WOrenburg§! grinds and struggles. Few major industrial centers exist and most of the population is employed on farms or in cottage industries. Even if the skies weren't filled with bombers, the §WOrenburg Worker's State§! lacks the organization and will to industrialize the region.\n\nDespite the legends, §WOrenburg§! is disorganized and fragile. The §WWorker's Council§! is consumed by indecision, infighting, and bureaucracy. The village communes it represents are fiercely independent and oppose any efforts to centralize the region into something resembling a functioning government. If §WOrenburg§! is to survive, it must adapt.\n\nNot all agree with the §WWorker's Council§!, however. Calls for reform grow by the day and proponents of progress have organized around two very different men, united in their desire for progress, but opposed in nearly everything else. §WAleksander Burba§! imagines a technocratic republic that can carry §WOrenburg§! into the modern world, while his opponent §WGeorgy Malenkov§! rallies around an older, more soviet style of governance.\n\nA bright future lies before §WOrenburg§!, and the Urals as a whole, but only if she is strong enough to seize it...\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* Carefully manage political infighting in an effort to save the §WCouncil§! from destruction\n\n* §WConfront§! bandits and mad scientists in a battle for the future of the Urals\n\n* Lead §WOrenburg§! into the modern age, or collapse into obscurity"
 
 COUNTRY_INFO_LYSENKO: "§G==MAGNITOGORSK==§!\n\nThe town of §WMagnitogorsk§! was a boom-town, built up throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries to mine and process the incredibly rich iron deposits within Mount Magnitnaya. When the Second World War ended, the steel mills closed and the mountain lay dormant. But §WDoctor Trofim Lysenko§! and the §W22nd NKVD Motor Rifle Division§! arrived, transforming the former network of mines into a base of operations where few entered and even fewer returned. The locals soon gave Mount Magnitnaya a new name more befitting of its ominous reputation: §Wthe Black Mountain§!.\n\nFar beneath the mountain's surface, §WTrofim Lysenko§! continues  the "scientific" work that he started more than three decades prior. He has rejected the concepts of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution, considering them to be classist lies that falsely apply the capitalist theory of competition to nature. In reality, Mother Nature is a socialist and all things trend toward cooperation. Any rational scientist would call his theories Lamarckian pseudoscience, but they have long since been forced out of academia or purged from his clique of technocrats.\n\nPushed by the stress of his experienced, §WLysenko§! has realized that there is no boundary worth respecting when the future of socialism is on the line, and he has broken one of his few taboos: human experimentation. He has become desperate to applying his theories in the creation of a "New Soviet Man," something that the unfortunate residents of §WMagnitogorsk§! have learned firsthand.\n\nThose who aid in the kidnapping of test subjects are the §WNKVD§!, led by §WStepan Bunkov§!. Their path first crossed with the mad scientist's in the closing days of the Second World War, when they were charged with evacuating him and his research well behind the front lines. But when all order broke down, they were forced to cooperate and survive. §WLysenko§! convinced the officers that his work was vital to the restoration of the §GSoviet Union§!, and that any and all assistance they could render would be greatly rewarded when order was restored and the §RGerman invaders§! were expelled. It is a decision that §WBunkov§! may come to regret.\n\nDespite its relative isolation, §WMagnitogorsk§! is not alone. The surrounding warlord states of §RTyumen§!, §RZlatoust§!, and §RKostanay§! pay no attention to them, something they intend to reciprocate. The great foe to the west is the §RUral League§!, a band of Gulag prisoners turned altruistic militias who view §WLysenko§! and all his valuable aides as little more than bandits in need of driving out. A most unexpected, ally, however, lies to the south: the §GDirlewanger Brigade§!, a handy supply of muscle whose loyalty can be bought with loot and liquor. With any luck, they can serve as a source of not only test subjects, but also manpower in the event of a war with the §RUral League§!. Of course, any alliance with them is not likely to last much longer after their victory.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* Push the limits of science and try to create a New Soviet Man! However, the toll research takes on §WMagnitogorsk§! and Lysenko himself cannot be ignored\n\n* In the aim of mutual interest with the Dirlewanger Brigade, §Wdestroy§! the Ural League's threat once and for all\n\n* Keep the NKVD in §Wcheck§!, for they will not hesitate to act if they feel Lysenko is no longer acting for the greater good..."

 COUNTRY_INFO_DIRLEWANGER: "§G==THE DIRLEWANGER BRIGADE==§!\n\n§WThe Dirlewanger Brigade§! is the bane of the Southern Urals, and not without reason. It is not so much a nation-state as it is a roving army that turned to banditry, sowing blood and terror across the steppe. At its head is §WOskar Dirlewanger§!, an officer turned bandit king who revels in the suffering he inflicts upon the villages around him.\n\nTheir origins lie not in the Urals, but in the §RThird Reich§!, as a a penal battalion called the §W36th Waffen Grenadier Division§! under the command of §WSS-Oberführer Oskar Dirlewanger§!, a long-serving veteran with a history of alcoholism, sadistic violence, and rape. Rather than demobilize during the West Russian War, §Wthe Brigade§! fled the front lines and escaped into the wilderness. They have since accumulated a posse of thieves, exiles, bandits, deserters, and others who care more for bloodshed and loot than working alongside ex-§RNazis§!.\n\n§WThe Brigade§! pledges itself to no nation, swears loyalty to no foreign leader, and bows to no master but themselves. And although they are fenced into one of the poorest corners of the former §RSoviet Union§!, they have set their sites on greater prizes.\n\nTo the south and east lie the §RKazakh warlords§!, who are in a similar position: under-equipped, isolated, and without much in terms of loot. To the north are §Rthe Ural League§!, who in a way are an inverse of §Wthe Brigade§!: instead of soldiers-turned-bandits, they are former gulag inmates who became respectable soldiers who oppose banditry. There is also the secretive state of §GMagnitogorsk§!, who have common ground with §Wthe Brigade§! in their mutual hatred of §Rthe League§!, and their mutual interest may lead to an alliance of convenience. But to the west sits the crown jewel of §ROrenburg§!: untouched by warfare, led by a weak government, protected by a disorganized army, and ripe for the taking.\n\nThe goal of §Wthe Brigade§! is simple: ride anywhere they have not been before, shoot anyone who shoots back, grab as much wealth as they can carry, use the women for their satisfaction, slaughter anyone they can see, burn down what's left, and ride off in search of their next victims.\n\nA day may soon come where they are stopped and the last bandit lies dead on the steppe, and the people of the Urals may live without fear. But until that day comes, §Wthe Dirlewanger Brigade§! shall ride, and the world shall tremble before them!\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* Launch §Wraids§! upon neighboring warlords in the name of plunder and profit\n\n* §WReach§! out to Lysenko and the Black Mountain in the name of friendship... for now\n\n* Summon the banners of war and try to §Wdestroy§! the Ural League and §ROrenburg once and for all"

 COUNTRY_INFO_SUDWESTAFRIKA: "§G==RK. Südwestafrika==§!\n\nHeil! §WSüdwestafrika§!, firstborn of the Reich's dominions beyond the Mittelmeer. From the Namib's oases to Angola's jungles do you stretch - an eagle perched atop the Dark Continent, wings unfurled in all their majesty. Bastion of the §GLuftwaffe§!, inheritors of von Richtofen's and Hartmann's legacies, your planes fly unimperiled thousands of leagues in every direction. The §REnglishman's§! perfidy has been repaid in full a year past; now you are safe and strong under §GGermania's§! care once more. May you remain so for a thousand years hence!\n\n...At least, that was how a Minister stooge addressed the §WReichskommissariat§! a year after the war. Reality bears more nuance than can be fit into a propaganda piece.\n\nThe broad brushstrokes are true, of course, like any good bit of misinformation. The §GReich§! had longed for its lost colonies after the Great War, and wrested them back and more after they won the Second. Distinguished pilot and §WReichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck§! has thereafter governed both his home and the erstwhile Portuguese colony of Angola. With a man of his stature and deeds, §GGermania§! was certain §WReichskommissariat Südwestafrika§! would flourish for the decades to come. At the surface level, it has.\n\nHundreds of the §GReich's§! finest planes have made Windhoek its African nest. Nevermind the onerous costs of maintaining such a large fleet, and the supply lines and facilities to keep them in proper shape. Nevermind the rust gathering on its pilots' hard-spent training, wasted on bombing runs against huts in the Niger or supply drops in the middle of nowhere. As trouble rumbles in §RSouth Africa§!, officers dread the moment their rusty sword is drawn past the Orange River.\n\nIts' cities are bastions of civilization among the uncivilized. Conversely, the §WReichskommissariat's§! authority fades the farther one strays from a short list of settlements. Where its jurisdiction is nonexistent in practice flourish a myriad of resistances and united fronts against the colonial menace, biding for the crucial moment their handlers had taught them. Meanwhile, the villagers under their protection wait eagerly for the bird handing gifts from the sky at least once a week.\n\nAt its' apex is §WReichskommissar Schenck§!, a man with a proven record of getting the job done. But that was twenty years ago. Now he spends more time flying his personal craft than in apprising his advisors of this year's plans. Sometimes, his servants catch him heading surreptitiously to one of his mansion's unused rooms at the same exact hour for days on end. Perhaps he was merely a man of privacy?\n\nNevertheless, §WSüdwestafrika§! bustles with action belying its sleepy countenance. In the skies above Windhoek, a flight that never flew draws skeins of vapor that stretch to the far north. In the jungles along the Cubango River, a band of rebels flit their gaze between their watches and the clear blue horizon. And in a Windhoek mansion, a penitent man gazes at the ceiling as he awakes from yet another nightmare.\n\nThe wall clock ticks closer to midnight. Sooner or later, he will have to make his choice.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* §WSiphon§! money from the Reich to improve your air fleet - or your subjects' lives\n\n* Lead the battle against South Africa from the §Wskies§!\n\n* Affirm your loyalty to Germania... or §Wfree§!

 COUNTRY_INFO_ZENTRALAFRIKA: "§G==RK. ZENTRALAFRIKA==§!\n\n§WReichskommissariat Zentralafrika§! is often called the '§GJewel of Africa§!' by the citizens of the §GReich§!.

A land of unprecedented colonial wealth (and exploitation) and prestige.\n\n§WReichskommissar Siegfried Müller§! is owed many thanks for the colony's strong management... or at least that's what the §GReich§! thinks. While often lauded as the model of a German explorer; brave, adventurous, and an impeccable host, the reality is that §WZentralafrika§! is the greatest example of financial fraud in human history.\n\nIndustrial equipment is shipped to §WMüller§!, who then has them sold abroad for well-under market value after they are 'lost' to actions against partisans that never actually occur. Those he does keep are, when not given to Africans to ostensibly use against themselves, stockpiled until they're sold back to the §GReich§! and branded as having been built in §WZentralafrikan§! factories.\n\nThese reprints are done in an §RAmerican§! owned factory, foreign corporations (half of which are officially embargoed) representing the vast majority of §WZentralafrika's§! production. On the ground, foreign mercenaries guard foreign factories in foreign controlled zones of occupation, while §WMüller§! presides over a bureaucracy almost as corrupt as he is, only running thanks to its owners fears of reprisal and personal greed.\n\nSaid mercenaries can be found working under the §WZentralafrikan§! umbrella across Africa. §WZentralafrikan§! mercenaries give German guns and training to guerrillas in all three Reichskommissariats, they assist the §RSouth African§! army in patrolling its borders, they even help operate anti-air weaponry in §RWestern Africa§!.\n\n§WMüller§! himself, despite being the lovechild of Germany and a character in seven different films, two moderately successful novel series, a popular recruitment poster for settlement in Africa, and somehow the interviewee on the §RAmerican§! 'Tonight Show', is not at all interested in good governance. Instead he focuses on hunting and carousing, and semi-secretly lives the life of Germany's greatest hedonist instead of its greatest patriot.\n\nLuckily, as long as peace lasts, nothing can stop the good times from rolling...\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* §WSafari§! with foreign dignitaries for prestige and a damn good time\n\n* Balance pleasure and business as you negotiate with foreign and domestic §Winvestors§!\n\n* Use the §Wmercenary§! companies of the Kongo jungle to do your dirty work\n\n"

It is likely that pacts will form, but the question is ultimately what to do once they outlast their use... and what to do if forces outside of the Urals some day come knocking to their door.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* A §Wshort§!, five year game, aimed at defeating the opposing two (or three) factions in the Urals\n\n* §WUnify§! the communes of Orenburg or handle Lysenko's waning §Wsanity§!, §Wravage§! Russia as the King of Bandits or §Wprotect§! it as its staunchest defenders\n\n* Completion of the five year fight for the Urals will end in §Wending slides§!, as planned in the final twenty year release of the mod"

 REGIONAL_INFO_AFRICA: "§G==SOUTHERN AFRICA==\n\n§!From the Sahara's fringes to the Cape of Good Hope, Central and Southern Africa simmers with the aftershocks of conflicts both old and new. The §WReich's§! resurgence has not left the §YDark Continent§! untouched; its talons have gouged a sea out of its heartland, and its sons hold sway over a dominion past two thousand miles from end to end. But the glorious years have passed §WGermania§!. Now its grip loosens with every day bickering paralyzes the Volkshalle.\n\nNot all has fallen to the fascist menace, however. At the continent's tip burns defiant the §WUnion of South Africa§!, among the old Empire's last dominions across the seas - certainly the last of what had once stretched from Cape Town to Cairo. Its fortunes have waned since the war's end; with Namibia torn from its grasp and its own people split in three loyalties, Africa's last democracy flickers and wanes amidst incessant threats of secession, rebellion, and invasion. Nevertheless, the Union's men hold firm along the Orange River's banks, steeling themselves with the certitude of a death in defense of their homes.\n\nFor to their north stands a triumvirate of Africa's most powerful men: §YReichskommissars Wolfgang Schenck§!, §YSiegfried Müller§! and §YHans Hüttig§!, viceroys of a third each of the Reich's Mittelafrikan conquests. Though cartographers depict their lands as one contiguous stretch of pitch black the same shade as the Heimat's, each §WReichskommissariat§! cannot be any more different from the rest. Companies and mercenaries the world over loot §WZentralafrika's§! vast wealth unheeded as §YMüller§! eagerly plans his next hunting expedition. §YSchenck§! and his Luftwaffe dance among the clouds far above §WSüdwestafrika§!, heedless of the troubles plaguing his subjects below.\n\nOnly §YHüttig§!, master of the Dark Continent's true Aryan bastion and overseer of a million slaves, casts a frigid eye beyond §WOstafrika's§! borders. Few but his closest advisors can divine the plans lurking in the zealot's mind; with his tendencies, fewer bet they will bring the continent anything but misery and grief.\n\nIt is 1962, and the §WNew Order§! frays at its edges. Old enmities resurge as a thousand plans spring into action. Circumstance binds three desperate eagles into one hesitant, tenuous alliance. Far in the distance, like a thunderous tempest, war comes to spill blood onto the savannah's sands once more. Strap up your NF-LAG, pack your OD greens, and don't forget the old refrain as you wage the §RSouth African War§!: §Wbravo don't surf.§!\n\n§G==FEATURES==\n\n§!* Fight a §Rconflict§! involving nations around the world, which may decide the Cold War's fate\n\n* Set the stage for §YAfrica's§! future, with many possible outcomes in the continent\n\n* New content - events, mechanics, nations - added since the previous demo\n\n"

## Mod Features
 MOD_FEATURES_TEXT: "§R==NOTICE==§!\nThis mod is a §RDEMO!§!\n\nThat means that §RONLY SOUTH AFRICA, RKS SUDWESTAFRIKA, ZENTRALAFRIKA, OSTAFRIKA, AND ORENBURG, THE URAL LEAGUE, MAGNITOGORSK, AND THE DIRLEWANGER BRIGADE HAVE CONTENT!§!\n\nPlease see the §WMod Info§! page to learn how you can keep track of development and when release is coming!\n\n§W================\n==MOD FEATURES==\n================§!\n\n§Y==ECONOMICS==§!\n§WThe New Order: Don't Surf§! now proudly features the long awaited §Weconomy§! mechanic. You can access your economic overview by clicking upon the §Wdollar sign§! in between the §Wproduction§! and §Wconstruction§! tabs. The foundation of your national economy is your §GGDP§!, which will be the key to the economic prosperity of your state. Your §GGDP§! needs to be balanced out with your §Rdebt§!. Every year, interest upon your §Rdebt§! will be deducted as an expense, and ending up with too high of a §RDebt§! to §GGDP§! ratio could spell financial ruin.\n\nTo avoid troubling economic times, keep a watchful eye upon your §Gincome§! and your §Yexpenditures§!. Your §Gincome§! is determined by multiple factors, the most obvious of which being your §GGDP§!. Many other factors come to play, however, such as your industry, poverty rate, academia, and much more! On the other hand, you have your §Yexpenditures§!, the bane of any economist. §YExpenditures§! are a measure of factors such as military upkeep, social securities, construction projects, and more.\n\nIn §WThe New Order§!, balance is key. Reckless §Yexpenditure§! can swiftly lead to high levels of §Rdebt§!, which can in time spiral into insolvency and §Reconomic meltdown§!. On the other hand, a carefully and cleverly guided economy can result in high levels of §GGDP growth§!, comfortable monetary reserves, and a bright future for your nation.\n\n§Y==OVERHAULED WAR==§!\n§RWar§! features heavily in §WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§!. Players lead a military of the Cold War. Units have been nearly completely overhauled from Hearts of Iron IV. Helicopters and Air Cavalry ease ground attack and troop movement, and new tech trees devoted to §RAir Cavalry§! warfare have been developed. Armor featured in the mod is modern, with §GMBTs§! taking the mainstage on the battlefield and an entirely new armor setup. Players, however, should not forget about infantry and mobile infantry technologies. Armor and air technologies are no replacement for boots on the ground! \n\nOn the coasts, new naval technologies like §Rmodern aircraft carriers and stealth ships§! control the seas. TNO's reworked naval tech uniquely reflects the dynamic nature of warfare in the Cold War. In the air, the player may advance in bomber and fighter technologies that have been added to simulate the unstable world and wars of The New Order. \n\nPerhaps the most important decision any player must make is the future of their §Rmilitary doctrines§!. The introduction of long guerilla wars changed how wars were not just thought about, but fought. The blitz of the Second World War is no more, replaced by long slogs in hostile terrain. Victory is no longer a certainty, and a player's choices must reflect this. §ROrders of Battles§! have been changed and units shifted around to reflect this reality. §WThousands of new generals§! have been added to give the player a diversity of characters to lead their armies.\n\n§R==Mutually Assured Destruction==§!\n§WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§! ultimately takes place during a Cold War, and not a World War. Each of the major three nations: §Wthe United States§!, §WGermany§!, and §WJapan§!, enjoy full §Rnuclear triad capabilities§! as of 1962; locking the world under the fear of §Rnuclear holocaust§!.\n\nAs such, nations are ultimately at the whim of the §Gsuperpowers§! of the world, and they are forever locked against one another without the means to secure an easy victory. Any war between the three §Gsuperpowers§! will inevitably be §RWorld War III§!.\n\nWhen §RWorld War III§! is fought, it can not end well. The sides will fight until one side begins to falter. If a nation feels that it is about to collapse, is unable to continue a war, or has their core territory overwhelmingly threatened then §Rnuclear war§! is an inevitability. If a nuclear strike is launched, it will be a matter of days until thousands of nuclear weapons are deployed in the war. If this happens, it is §Rgame over§!!Luckily, diplomacy is the norm. §RNuclear war§! is rare, extremely so if not playing as a nuclear power, and most nations would rather work through issues instead of fight over them. The §WDEFCON§! tracker in the §RWorld Tension§! menu in the top right will tell you how high the §WDEFCON§! level is globally. The higher this is, the more likely that diplomatic options will fail. At max levels of §WDEFCON§!, war is inevitable.\n\n§Y==PROXY WARS==§!\nThis does not mean that war is uncommon in §WThe New Order§!. On the contrary, war is actually §Gextremely common§! and you will fight several as almost every nation. However, wars are not expressed through direct conflict, but instead normally as §RProxy Wars§!. §RProxy Wars§! are wars between two nations, who are backed by two larger nations using their conflict as a way to battle one another without an outright battle. These can also occur during §RCivil Wars§!, which are also exceedingly common.\n\nDuring a §RProxy War§!, nations at war with one another may find themselves being supported by an outside power. If nobody is playing as the backing power, then units will be gifted to the nation fighting the war. If a player is the backing power, however, they will be able to support their side via the §WVolunteer System§! as in vanilla §WHearts of Iron IV§!.\n\nBe careful however! Proxy wars are dangerous prospects, and can rapidly increase the §WDEFCON§! level! §RDiplomatic Crisis'§! may be common, and possibly influenced by external actors. One wrong move, and you can cause global destruction.\n\n§Y==DIPLOMATIC CRISIS==§!\n§RDiplomatic Crisis§! are randomly fired throughout the duration of many wars and §RProxy Wars§!. A §RDiplomatic Crisis§! is an event chain showing an increase in tension that can escalate to full on global war. Traditionally, this means an event is fired for one §Wparticipant§! in a conflict, allowing them to take some form of lose by backing down from the crisis or gain by pushing against the other power. The defending power will then get the opportunity to do the same, and escalate further or back down. This continues for some time, with the reward increasing but alongside the loss, until one side buckles and backs down. If no side backs down, §Rthis will spark war between both sides!§!\n\n§RDiplomatic Crisis§! become more common the higher the §WDEFCON§! level is, and can also be fired during peace time! Remember to put the safety of the world before pride, or to exploit the game of powers in order to encourage the conflict...\n\n§G==NARRATIVE==§!\n\n§WThe New Order§! and its demo are a §Gnarrative§! based mod. This means that the mod is more story based than any other for §WHearts of Iron IV§!\n\nWhat this really means is that the gameplay loop of §GHearts of Iron IV§! is very different from the one of §WThe New Order§!. Gone is the linear build up towards a war with the option to choose an ideology before then, with an occasional event fired to give you a small boost. Instead, you will be navigating a country much like a §W'Choose Your Own Adventure'§! novel. While there will be plenty of opportunity for war, gameplay decisions, and many many nations have their own mechanics to learn, ultimately the feeling is one of playing a story.\n\nSo please, sit back, relax and enjoy the story while you work through your country. Paths should generally be self explanatory and if you find yourself overly confused please let us know and we'll see what we can do to make it easier in the future. We don't anticipate too much issue though, so enjoy the game, and let us know what you think!"
